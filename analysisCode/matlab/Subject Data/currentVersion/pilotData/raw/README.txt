Subjects 8-20 were run in just the study phase (3x reps of each item)
with variable presentation durations. The goal is to get an accurate 
psychisical curve that describes how long to present the cfs images

clarification: for subjects <8, we can't garuntee that the glasses were working.
many of them were probably getting too close to the screen, interferrring with the 
shutterring. Basically, don't bother with data from subjects <8. Actually, it could 
be the case that we only want to look at the last 9 subjects, because only these ones
had their phone explicitly taken away when testing.
